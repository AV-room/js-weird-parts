# js-weird-parts

Following along with Anthony Alicea's Udemy course (JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts) to build a small JavaScript framework.

Framework requirements:
- When given a first name, last name, and optional language, it generates formal and informal greetings.
- Support English and Spanish languages.
- Be reusable i.e. won't interfere with any of the other JS code in our app, and other people should be able to grab it and use it in their apps without issue.
- Easy to type 'G$()' structure.
- Support JQuery i.e. we should be able to give this framework a JQuery object that points at some HTML element, and it will fill that element with the greeting.
